# geotiff

A noGDAL tool for reading and writing geotiff files

WARNING this package is under development and some features are unstable. Use with caution. 

### What is noGDAL?

**[noGDAL](https://kipcrossing.github.io/2021-01-03-noGDAL/)** is a philosophy for developing geospatial programs in python without using GDAL.

### Instillation

Installing this package is as easy as:

```
pip install geotiff
```

### Usage

Read the GeoTiff to an array

```python
from geotiff import GeoTiff

geoTiff = GeoTiff(tiff_file)
array = geoTiff.read()
```

Read a sections of a large tiff using a WGS 84 area

```python
from geotiff import GeoTiff

area_box = [(138.632071411, -32.447310785), (138.644218874, -32.456979174)]
geotiff = GeoTiff(tiff_file)
array = geotiff.read_box(area_box)
```

This will detect and convert coordinates into WGS 84

You can also get the coordinated of the actual bounding box

```python
geotiff.tif_bBox
```

And the original crs code

```python
geotiff.crs_code
```

To help users and and other contributes, be sure to:
- make doc blocs if appropriate
- use typing wherever possible. 

*Note:* The continuous integration has lint checking with **mypy**, so be sure to check it yourself before making a PR.

### Project Road Map

#### Core Features

- [x] read tiff files (including BigTiff)
